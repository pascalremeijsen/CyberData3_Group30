# CyberData3_Group30

The .ipynb files contain our code. We included a zip file with our assignment submission: this contains two .pkl files so you do not have to run the data preprocessing.
Just unzip this file and put the .pkl files in the same directory as the .ipynb files.

For the KNIME workflow: open KNIME, press file -> Import KNIME Workflow and use the bonustask.knwf file.
